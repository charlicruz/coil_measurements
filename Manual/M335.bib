In addition to the currently used underlying networks and protocols, new wired/wireless approaches are being planned for deployment for different components/applications of the SG. Based on the data requirements of the applications, new challenges have arisen at the network layer of the protocol stack with respect to routing and data forwarding. In this paper, we focus on the routing issues in the SG communications infrastructure which consists of different network components, such as Home Area Networks (HANs), Neighborhood Area Networks (NANs) and Wide Area Networks (WANs). We provide a comprehensive survey of the existing routing research and analyze the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed protocols with respect different applications areas. We also identify the future research issues that are yet to be addressed with respect to the applications and network components. This survey is the first to identify routing design issues for the SG and categorize the proposed routing protocols from the SG applications perspective. We believe that this work will be valuable for the utilities and other energy companies whose target is to develop and deploy a specific SG application that may span different network components. In addition, this work will provide valuable insights for the newcomers who would like to pursue routing related research in the SG domain."

Unceasing growth of population and urbanization have intensified innovative ways to handle urbanization with minimal impact on environment, citizen lifestyles, and governance. Initial integration of information communication technology (ICT) into city operations have promoted telicity, information city, and digital city concepts. Later, the conception of IoT has founded the smart cities, which support the city operations intelligently with minimal human interaction. Smart city emerged as a solution to address the challenges arise with exponential growth of urbanization and population. However, smart city concept is still evolving and not mainstreamed throughout the globe due to technological, economical, and governing barriers. Therefore, this paper aims to deliver the essence of smart cities. The paper presents a brief overview of smart cities, followed by the features and characteristics, generic architecture, composition, and real-world implementations of smart cities. Finally, we present some challenges and opportunities identified through extensive literature survey on smart cities."

The proposed architecture exploits power line communications (PLC) at both low and medium voltage level, thanks to new devices and an innovative medium voltage PLC coupling system. The new coupling solution and the whole smart metering architecture are experimentally verified in a wide frequency range, from CENELEC A band up to 200 kHz, by using different modulation techniques; the on-field measurement campaign has been carried out on the distribution network of Favignana Island (Mediterranean Sea). Success rate and RTT measured in real environment confirm the feasibility of the proposed solution."

An important element of such a smart grid is prosumers i.e. the consumers who also produce and share surplus energy with grid and other users. Prosumers are not only an important stakeholder of the future smart grids but also have a vital role in peak demand management. Therefore, it is needed to investigate and review the Prosumers based Energy Management and Sharing (PEMS) along with associated challenges. It will help in understanding and analyzing the impact of prosumers in future smart grids. In order to achieve these objectives, this paper presents a comprehensive review of PEMS in smart grid environment and associated impact on power system reliability and energy sustainability. The process of energy sharing among prosumers involves two key elements: information and communication technologies and optimization techniques. These two elements have been discussed in detail to cover the PEMS implementation requirements. The relevant communications technologies presented in the paper include wired, wireless, short and long range options while linear and nonlinear optimization techniques, in context of PEMS, are described. Various technologies, methodologies and mechanisms adopted for PEMS are comprehensively discussed in order to enhance readers’ intuition. Challenges and issues faced by prosumer communities and energy sharing have also been elaborated in detail."

More importantly, with recent advancements in PLC technological regulation, standardization and certification have spurred a lot of interest in the field of advanced communication and control technologies for heterogeneous networks. These advancements are expected to greatly enhance efficiency and reliability of future power systems with renewable energy resources, as well as distributed intelligence and demand response (DR) programs. As various national and international organizations have started to draw PLC regulations, standards and technologies for countries, these standards intend to determine important criteria such as bandwidth, modulation types, channel coding schemes, operating frequency and electromagnetic capability limits from fixed indoor/outdoor applications to smart grid (SG) applications. Depending on the worldwide PLC regulation, standardization and technological developments, security schemes built around them can become interoperable from a standard point of view, but still have incompatible configurations or different maturity levels, or include non-standardized PLC functions. Moreover, the PLC based systems/solutions for renewable energy integration, are also surveyed in terms of distributed-power system (DPS) and distributed energy resources (DERs) units monitoring/controlling and management purposes. Thus, a particular section is dedicated to PLC based systems/solutions utilization of renewable energy sources (RESs) in SG covering all aspects of a monotype and hybrid energy plants. Finally, the survey is carried on by reviewing the most recent and comprehensive articles to highlight the importance of PLC in a logical way in the smart grid for readers."

The flexibility from five types of appliances available within residential premises (washing machines, tumble dryers, dishwashers, domestic hot water buffers and electric vehicles), is quantified based on measurements from the LINEAR pilot, a large-scale research and demonstration project focused on the introduction of demand response at residential premises in the Flanders region in Belgium. The flexibility potential of the smart appliances, or the maximal amount of time a certain increase or decrease of power can be realized within the comfort requirements of the user, is calculated. In general, the flexibility potential varies during the day, and the potential for increasing or decreasing the power consumption is in general not equal. Additionally, an extrapolation of the flexibility potential of wet appliances is presented for Belgium. The analysis shows that, using smart wet appliances, an average maximum increase of 430W per household can be realized at midnight, and a maximum decrease of 65W per household can be realized in the evening. The resulting flexibility potential can be used as an instrument to determine the impact or economic viability of demand response programs for residential premises."

They are expected to shift from a passive role as consumer of electricity to an active role as co-provider. In this article, the extent to which current technologies, products and services empower end-users to take up an active role as co-providers is evaluated. Based on a review of literature and related pilot projects, current approaches were found to be driven by technical and financial considerations. There appears to be a lack of product and service design that supports end-users in their role as co-providers in a smart grid. This is reflected in the lack of thought given to how the end-users’ process of behavioral change can be supported to enable the transition from consumer to co-provider. Several recommendations are provided for product and service designers towards fostering the role of co-provider, which comes under under: (a) user interaction needs, (b) approaches to behavioral change and (c) community initiatives and management of resources. Designers are considered to play a bridging role between policy making and engineering, while facilitating involvement of end-users in the design process."

Custom-coded in-home displays (IHDs) were created to provide real-time household electricity consumption feedback, and were framed as either (a) simple kW consumption, or (b) kW consumption and the corresponding cost, or (c) kW consumption and a dynamically-derived social normative frame. Analyses focused on household electricity consumption in the first week following deployment, and again over a 3-month time span. Findings showed that households receiving simple feedback, and feedback framed as cost did not differ significantly from the randomized control at either the 1-week or the 3-month time points. Similarly, results showed that educational materials alone did not reduce electricity consumption. However, significant effects were found for households receiving the normative frame, which consumed 9% less than control households during the initial 1-week evaluation period, and 7% less during the full 3-month evaluation period. Yet despite these findings, residents reported more positive experiences and more obligations to conserve electricity with the cost and feedback IHDs. The results suggest that in-home displays offer promise for encouraging energy conservation, but careful consideration should be given to the way that the feedback is framed."

abstract = "Two residential Smart Grid pilots, PowerMatching City, Groningen (NL) and Pecan Street, Austin Texas (USA) have been compared regarding their energy performance and the experiences of users in these pilots. The objective of the comparison was to gain new insights that could support the successful deployment of future residential Smart Grids. Measured data on electricity generation and electricity consumption of households in 2013 and 2014 were evaluated. Existing reports with results of surveys of users were also analyzed. The energy performance revealed that the average domestic electricity consumption of households in PowerMatching City was lower compared to Pecan Street (2.6GWh versus 10.1GWh). At the same time, households in Pecan Street generated a higher amount of electricity compared to PowerMatching City (6.8GWh versus 1.14GWh). Households in Pecan Street consumed on average, 8% less electricity with respect to the USA average household domestic electricity consumption of 10.9GWh; while households in PowerMatching City consumed 19% less electricity compared to the Dutch average household domestic electricity consumption of 3.1GWh. Households in PowerMatching City appeared to have a higher potential to contribute to electricity demand and supply balancing, because their electricity consumption from the grid was largely reduced with increased self-generation. User experiences revealed that end-users in both pilots preferred technologies that automatically shift their energy use, since this requires minimal effort from them. We conclude that the pattern of households’ electricity generation and consumption in Smart Grid pilot projects, and their contribution to peak load balancing in the electricity network is largely influenced by existing Smart Grid set-ups, local climate and related needs for heating and cooling, the average capacity of installed energy generating technologies and the prevailing energy behavior."

abstract = "Electricity networks are experiencing increasing congestion and reliability issues as current generation and transmission infrastructures endeavour to match the supply with demand. The integration of intermittent renewable energy resources such as photovoltaic (PV) systems has led to a large variation in energy production and increased supply uncertainty in power systems. In this context, demand-side management (DSM) schemes can be used to motivate prosumers to refine their energy behaviours by offering them various incentives. This study presents a universally-applied methodology that will promote the deployment of effective price-based DSM for residential prosumers. The proposed methodology can be applied on both prosumers and consumers since the utilization of the net-load profile was found to reduce the percentage of unintended revenues by 15%. Additionally, the effectiveness of the methodology was validated through a pilot-network of 300 residential prosumers with installed rooftop PV systems, and resulted in seasonally dependent peak consumption reduction in the range of 1.03% and 3.19% and a reduction of the overall consumption by approximately 2%. Finally, the conducted cost-benefit analysis demonstrated an overall net-benefit of €4.62mln, over a 15-year period, when considering assumptions that are linked to the costs and benefits of a nationwide deployment of the proposed DSM scheme."

Thus, the present research attempted to gain an insight into the factors that drive residential electricity consumers, particularly those with low income, towards or away from demand side management and distributed energy resources. The results of a consumer survey of 207 Japanese households revealed that there is a clear correlation between low-household income and the willingness of the respondents to reduce their energy expenditures. In contrast, the fear of the perceived additional cost required to implement these technologies, and the belief that consumers have inadequate information or support from the utility company, prevents them from adopting new technologies. Further, the results of a comparative analysis indicate that the reputation of the utility company is higher among smart grid users than traditional electricity consumers. The K-means clustering algorithm and hierarchical cluster analysis indicated that younger and poorer members of the society faced more barriers than middle age wealthier groups. The authors maintain that the electricity utilities thus need to develop a range of measures to engage residential consumers with heterogeneous socio-economic characteristics."

Through a comparative analysis of smart energy pilots in Norway, Austria, and Denmark, the study shows that economic incentives under certain conditions influence energy-consuming practices of households but not in ways anticipated by widespread rational conceptualisations within economic, engineering, and policy-making approaches. The paper elaborates the practice-theoretical understanding of financial structures in smart energy interventions and identifies the socio-material configurations causing price to play a role. This informs policymakers and developers of future smart energy interventions. The overall policy recommendation of the paper is that smart energy designers, planners, and policymakers need to consider the complexity of interrelated elements that co-determine the effectiveness of price incentives. Thus, a successful coupling between price incentives and demand response actions can best be realised via a productive mixture of mutually supporting elements (engagements, devices, and competences). In addition, the paper provides specific recommendations related to the design of effective and workable price schemes that fit into the everyday lives of households."

Recently however, some initiatives started to adopt smart grid technologies like Virtual Power Plants (VPP) which enables them to become involved in the distribution, trading and management of energy. By adopting a multiple-methods approach consisting of literature reviews on community energy and Virtual Power Plant, action research, semi-structured interviews and by mobilizing Family Resemblance, this article explores the community-based Virtual Power Plants as a novel model for energy provision. We identified five building blocks that together form a cVPP: the community involved, the community-logic under which the project operates, the portfolio of distributed energy resources aggregated and controlled by an ICT control architecture, and the roles communities can collectively play in the energy system by means of cVPP. Three practical cases in Ireland, Belgium and the Netherlands highlight the diversity of cVPPs, that results from different choices and trade-offs made by various communities in diverse institutional contexts. Applying the cVPP conceptualization made visible that the three cVPPs had to comply with the incumbent energy system, making it difficult to play the preferred roles in the energy system, operate on the scale of their community and to keep their own needs and values center stage."

Measuring the energy consumption of a household is however required in order to find and realize saving potentials. Thus, we show how to gain insights in the context of energy consumption directly from the energy consumption profile. Our proposed methods are capable of determining the user's current activity with an accuracy up to 98{\%} as well as the user's current place in a house with an accuracy up to 97{\%}. Furthermore, our solution is capable of detecting anomalies in the energy consumption behavior. All this is mainly achieved with the energy consumption profile.",

This paper presents a decentralized cooperative DR framework to manage the daily energy exchanges within a community of Smart-Buildings, in the presence of local Renewable Energy Sources (RES). The proposed algorithm taps into the flexibility of the participants to let them decide of a day-ahead community power profile, and subsequently ensures the forecast tracking during the next day. In practice, the algorithm is fully decentralized by the Blockchain technology, that enables a trusted communication medium among the participants and enforces autonomous monitoring and billing via Smart-Contracts. With such an energy management framework, participating Smart-Buildings can together aim at a common objective, such as carbon-free resources usage or aggregated grid services, without depending on a centralized aggregator/utility. Simulations on realistic Swiss building models demonstrate that nearly all the renewable production resources could be harnessed locally through the presented framework, compared to selfish individual optimization. Under a quadratic cost of grid electricity, the considered community profile could dramatically be flattened, hence avoiding costly peaks at the grid interface. A scalability analysis shows that, considering the current public Ethereum Blockchain, the framework could handle a community size of up to 100 Smart-Buildings."

The goal of achieving energy neutrality through maximized use of on-site produced renewable energy and attaining optimal level of energy performance at building-cluster level requires reliable short term (resolution shorter than one day) energy demand predictions. However, the prediction and analysis of the energy performance of buildings is still focused on the individual building level and not on small neighborhood scale or building clusters. In a smart grid context, to better understand electricity consumption at different spatial levels, prediction should be at both individual as well as at building-cluster levels, especially for neighborhoods with definite boundaries (such as universities, hospitals). Therefore, in this paper, using data from 47 commercial buildings, a number of machine learning algorithms were evaluated to predict the electricity demand at individual building level and aggregated level in hourly intervals. Predicting at hourly granularity is important to understand short-term dynamics, yet most of the neighborhood scale studies are limited to yearly, monthly, weekly, or daily data resolutions. Two years of data were used in training the model and the prediction was performed using another year of untrained data. Learning algorithms such as; boosted-tree, random forest, SVM-linear, quadratic, cubic, fine-Gaussian as well as ANN were all analysed and tested for predicting the electricity demand of individual and groups of buildings. The results showed that boosted-tree, random forest, and ANN provided the best outcomes for prediction at hourly granularity when metrics such as computational time and error accuracy are compared."

Efficiency improvements and advanced control strategies have a significant impact in the reduction of energy costs and CO2 emissions. Building energy simulation is widely used to help planners, contractors, and building owners analyse diverse options regarding the planning and management of energy consumption in buildings. Furthermore, recent advances in data processing and computing have led to the development of sophisticated machine learning algorithms that can learn from large datasets, e.g., sensor data from buildings, and use them to develop building-specific adaptive and automatic energy controllers. Control algorithms, such as deep reinforcement learning can tune themselves, are model-free, and economical to implement. In this paper, we introduce an integrated simulation environment that combines CitySim, a fast building energy simulator, and TensorFlow, a platform for efficient implementation of advanced machine learning algorithms. The integration is achieved via Keras—an API for TensorFlow—and a set of text and csv files for data transfer between the applications. This new environment will allow researchers to investigate novel learning control algorithms, and demonstrate their robustness and potential for diverse applications in the built environment. We present two case studies for energy savings and demand response, respectively."

There is a need to add intelligence at all levels in the grid, acting over various time horizons. Predicting the behavior of the energy system is crucial to mitigate potential uncertainties. An accurate energy prediction at the customer level will reflect directly in efficiency improvements in the whole system. However, prediction of building energy consumption is complex due to many influencing factors, such as climate, performance of thermal systems, and occupancy patterns. Therefore, current state-of-the-art methods are not able to confine the uncertainty at the building level due to the many fluctuations in influencing variables. As an evolution of artificial neural network (ANN)-based prediction methods, deep learning techniques are expected to increase the prediction accuracy by allowing higher levels of abstraction. In this paper, we investigate two newly developed stochastic models for time series prediction of energy consumption, namely Conditional Restricted Boltzmann Machine (CRBM) and Factored Conditional Restricted Boltzmann Machine (FCRBM). The assessment is made on a benchmark dataset consisting of almost four years of one minute resolution electric power consumption data collected from an individual residential customer. The results show that for the energy prediction problem solved here, FCRBM outperforms ANN, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and CRBM."

Prior work has attempted to mitigate these problems by using sensor-based machine learning approaches to statistically model energy consumption, applying the techniques primarily to commercial building data, which makes use of hourly consumption data. It is unclear, however, whether these techniques can translate to residential buildings, since the energy usage patterns may vary significantly. Until now, most residential modeling research only had access to monthly electrical consumption data. In this article, we report on the evaluation of seven different machine learning algorithms applied to a new residential data set that contains sensor measurements collected every 15min, with the objective of determining which techniques are most successful for predicting next hour residential building consumption. We first validate each learner's correctness on the ASHRAE Great Energy Prediction Shootout, confirming existing conclusions that Neural Network-based methods perform best on commercial buildings. However, our additional results show that these methods perform poorly on residential data, and that Least Squares Support Vector Machines perform best – a technique not previously applied to this domain."

ABSTRACT = {Building energy consumption prediction plays an important role in improving the energy utilization rate through helping building managers to make better decisions. However, as a result of randomness and noisy disturbance, it is not an easy task to realize accurate prediction of the building energy consumption. In order to obtain better building energy consumption prediction accuracy, an extreme deep learning approach is presented in this paper. The proposed approach combines stacked autoencoders (SAEs) with the extreme learning machine (ELM) to take advantage of their respective characteristics. In this proposed approach, the SAE is used to extract the building energy consumption features, while the ELM is utilized as a predictor to obtain accurate prediction results. To determine the input variables of the extreme deep learning model, the partial autocorrelation analysis method is adopted. Additionally, in order to examine the performances of the proposed approach, it is compared with some popular machine learning methods, such as the backward propagation neural network (BPNN), support vector regression (SVR), the generalized radial basis function neural network (GRBFNN) and multiple linear regression (MLR). Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method has the best prediction performance in different cases of the building energy consumption.},

ABSTRACT = {Energy consumers may not know whether their next-hour forecasted load is either high or low based on the actual value predicted from their historical data. A conventional method of level prediction with a pattern recognition approach was performed by first predicting the actual numerical values using typical pattern-based regression models, hen classifying them into pattern levels (e.g., low, average, and high). A proposed prediction with pattern recognition scheme was developed to directly predict the desired levels using simpler classifier models without undergoing regression. The proposed pattern recognition classifier was compared to its regression method using a similar algorithm applied to a real-world energy dataset. A random forest (RF) algorithm which outperformed other widely used machine learning (ML) techniques in previous research was used in both methods. Both schemes used similar parameters for training and testing simulations. After 10-time cross training validation and five averaged repeated runs with random permutation per data splitting, the proposed classifier shows better computation speed and higher classification accuracy than the conventional method. However, when the number of its desired levels increases, its prediction accuracy seems to decrease and approaches the accuracy of the conventional method. The developed energy level prediction, which is computationally inexpensive and has a good classification performance, can serve as an alternative forecasting scheme.},

This paper presents a decentralized cooperative DR framework to manage the daily energy exchanges within a community of Smart-Buildings, in the presence of local Renewable Energy Sources (RES). The proposed algorithm taps into the flexibility of the participants to let them decide of a day-ahead community power profile, and subsequently ensures the forecast tracking during the next day. In practice, the algorithm is fully decentralized by the Blockchain technology, that enables a trusted communication medium among the participants and enforces autonomous monitoring and billing via Smart-Contracts. With such an energy management framework, participating Smart-Buildings can together aim at a common objective, such as carbon-free resources usage or aggregated grid services, without depending on a centralized aggregator/utility. Simulations on realistic Swiss building models demonstrate that nearly all the renewable production resources could be harnessed locally through the presented framework, compared to selfish individual optimization. Under a quadratic cost of grid electricity, the considered community profile could dramatically be flattened, hence avoiding costly peaks at the grid interface. A scalability analysis shows that, considering the current public Ethereum Blockchain, the framework could handle a community size of up to 100 Smart-Buildings."

On the other hand, with the growth of bidirectional charging/discharging Plug-in Electric vehicles (PEV), the capability of storing electrical energy for load shifting and energy sharing among users may take smart grid to a next level. In the viewpoint of a community, we design a fairness strategy and apply particle swarm optimization (PSO) to get the near optimal sharing schedule within community and share PEV’s battery with neighbors to reduce the total electricity cost and peak-to-average ratio (PAR). On the other hand, we try to utilize the PEVs which park at the commercial building during working hour to be involved with part of the building’s power consumption. In the simulation, we have collected ten daily activity profiles from ten different people to represent the residents in the community and use the hourly load profile data from the Office of Energy Efficiency & Renewable Energy (EERE) for a commercial sector. The results show that the proposed DSM system not only reduces the electricity cost for each household but also reduces the PAR of the community. Moreover, for the commercial building, the proper rearrangement of PEVs’ behavior also helps to reduce the total electricity cost and PAR."

ABSTRACT = {Nowadays, the importance of energy management and optimization by means of smart devices has arisen as an important issue. On the other hand, the intelligent application of smart devices stands as a key element in establishing smart cities, which have been suggested as the solution to complicated future urbanization difficulties in coming years. Considering the scarcity of traditional fossil fuels in the near future, besides their ecological problems the new smart grids have demonstrated the potential to merge the non-renewable and renewable energy resources into each other leading to the reduction of environmental problems and optimizing operating costs. The current paper clarifies the importance of smart grids in launching smart cities by reviewing the advancement of micro/nano grids, applications of renewable energies, energy-storage technologies, smart water grids in smart cities. Additionally a review of the major European smart city projects has been carried out. These will offer a wider vision for researchers in the operation, monitoring, control and audit of smart-grid systems.},

ABSTRACT = {With the development of renewable energy technology and communication technology in recent years, many residents now utilize renewable energy devices in their residences with energy storage systems. We have full confidence in the promising prospects of sharing idle energy with others in a community. However, it is a great challenge to share residents&rsquo; energy with others in a community to minimize the total cost of all residents. In this paper, we study the problem of energy management and task scheduling for a community with renewable energy and residential cogeneration, such as residential combined heat and power system (resCHP) to pay the least electricity bill. We take elastic and inelastic load demands into account which are delay intolerant and delay tolerant tasks in the community. The minimum cost problem of a non-cooperative community is extracted into a random non-convex optimization problem with some physical constraints. Our objective is to minimize the time-average cost for each resident in the community, including the cost of the external grid and natural gas. The Lyapunov optimization theory and a primal-dual gradient method are adopted to tackle this problem, which needs no future data and has low computational complexity. Furthermore, we design a cooperative renewable energy sharing algorithm based on State-action-reward-state-action (Sarsa) Algorithm, in the condition that each residence in the community is able to communicate with its neighbors by a central controller. Finally, extensive simulations are presented to validate the proposed algorithms by using practical data.},

ABSTRACT = {With the rapid development of smart community technologies, how to improve user comfort levels and make full use of renewable energy have become urgent problems. This paper proposes an optimization algorithm to minimize daily energy costs while considering user comfort level and renewable energy consumption rate. In this paper, the structure of a typical smart community and the output models of all components installed in the community are introduced first. Then, the characteristics of different types of loads are analyzed, followed by defining the coefficients of user comfort level. In this step, the influence of load-scheduling on user comfort level and the renewable energy consumption rate is emphasized. Finally, based on the time-of-use gas price, this paper optimizes the daily energy costs for an off-grid community under the constraints of the comfort level and renewable energy consumption rate. Results show that scheduling transferable loads and interruptible loads are not independent to each other, and improving user comfort level requires spending more money as compensation. Moreover, fully consuming renewable energy has side effects on energy bills and battery lifetime. It is more conducive to system economy and stability if the maximum renewable energy consumption rate is restricted to 95%.},

This paper develops a combined analytical framework that will assist in the process of multi-source data integration and uncertain reasoning of SCE. This framework is used to combine quantitative metrics and subjective judgment with evidential reasoning approach, and this frarmework can also take decision makers’ risk preferences into consideration using prospect theory. Four urban communities are evaluated by the proposed framework to demonstrate its applicability and effectiveness."

abstract="The Internet of Things is a new technological step in the anytime, everywhere, anything IP connectivity context. Things (sensors, wearable objects, connected cars{\ldots}) are equipped with computers and various communication resources. IoT devices deal with Wireless Local Area Network, Wireless Personal Area Network, Near Field Communication, or new operated radio networks with low throughput such as SIGFOX or LoRA. In this context security and trust are very critical topics, both for users and service providers. In this paper we present new and innovative security modules based on ISO7816 chips, which have been recently introduced by an IETF draft. These low cost, low power, tamper resistant devices, run TLS and DTLS stacks. DTLS is the datagram adaptation of the well known TLS protocol, which is de facto standard for the internet security. It is the security layer of the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) targeting sensors networks in a context of smart energy and building automation. We shortly recall TLS and DTLS features, and introduce the flights concept. We present the TLS/DTLS security module interface, which is based on previous work dealing with the EAP-TLS protocol, widely used for authentication in wireless networks and VPNs. We describe our prototype platform based on a java framework that implement a software bridge with the TLS/DTLS security module and which is compatible with the popular Raspberry Pi board. Finally we detail the experimental performances, compatible with the constraints of IoT, observed for an implementation running in a javacard.",

ABSTRACT = {The fast growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) has made this technology one of the most promising paradigms of recent years. Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are one of the most important challenges of the Internet of things. These networks are made up of devices with limited processing power, memory, and energy. The constrained nature of WSNs makes it necessary to have specific restricted protocols to work in these environments. In this paper, we present an energy consumption and network traffic study of the main IoT application layer protocols, the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), and the version of Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT) for sensor networks (MQTT SN). The simulations presented evaluate the performance of these protocols with different network configurations.},

ABSTRACT = {With the proliferation of smart devices capable of communicating over a network using different protocols, each year more and more successful attacks are recorded against these, underlining the necessity of developing and implementing mechanisms to protect against such attacks. This paper will review some existing solutions used to secure a communication channel, such as Transport Layer Security or symmetric encryption, as well as provide a novel approach to achieving confidentiality and integrity of messages. The method, called Value-to-Keyed-Hash Message Authentication Code (Value-to-HMAC) mapping, uses signatures to send messages, instead of encryption, by implementing a Keyed-Hash Message Authentication Code generation algorithm. Although robust solutions exist that can be used to secure the communication between devices, this paper considers that not every Internet of Things (IoT) device or network design is able to afford the overhead and drop in performance, or even support such protocols. Therefore, the Value-to-HMAC method was designed to maximize performance while ensuring the messages are only readable by the intended node. The experimental procedure demonstrates how the method will achieve better performance than a symmetric-key encryption algorithm, while ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of information through the use of one mechanism.},

ABSTRACT = {Presently, the advancements in the electric system, smart meters, and implementation of renewable energy sources (RES) have yielded extensive changes to the current power grid. This technological innovation in the power grid enhances the generation of electricity to meet the demands of industrial, commercial and residential sectors. However, the industrial sectors are the focus of power grid and its demand-side management (DSM) activities. Neglecting other sectors in the DSM activities can deteriorate the total performance of the power grid. Hence, the notion of DSM and demand response by way of the residential sector makes the smart grid preferable to the current power grid. In this circumstance, this paper proposes a home energy management system (HEMS) that considered the residential sector in DSM activities and the integration of RES and energy storage system (ESS). The proposed HEMS reduces the electricity cost through scheduling of household appliances and ESS in response to the time-of-use (ToU) and critical peak price (CPP) of the electricity market. The proposed HEMS is implemented using the Earliglow based algorithm. For comparative analysis, the simulation results of the proposed method are compared with other methods: Jaya algorithm, enhanced differential evolution and strawberry algorithm. The simulation results of Earliglow based optimization method show that the integration of RES and ESS can provide electricity cost savings up to 62.80% and 20.89% for CPP and ToU. In addition, electricity cost reduction up to 43.25% and 13.83% under the CPP and ToU market prices, respectively.},

ABSTRACT = {Although information and communications technologies (ICTs) have the potential of enabling powerful social, economic and environmental benefits, ICT systems give a non-negligible contribution to world electricity consumption and carbon dioxide (CO2) footprint. This contribution will sustain since the increased demand for user&prime;s connectivity and an explosion of traffic volumes necessitate continuous expansion of current ICTs services and deployment of new infrastructures and technologies which must ensure the expected user experiences and performance. In this paper, analyses of costs for the global annual energy consumption of telecommunication networks, estimation of ICT sector CO2 footprint contribution and predictions of energy consumption of all connected user-related devices and equipment in the period 2011&ndash;2030 are presented. Since presented estimations of network energy consumption trends for main communication sectors by 2030 shows that highest contribution to global energy consumption will come from wireless access networks and data centres (DCs), the rest of the paper analyses technologies and concepts which can contribute to the energy-efficiency improvements of these two sectors. More specifically, different paradigms for wireless access networks such as millimetre-wave communications, Long-Term Evolution in unlicensed spectrum, ultra-dense heterogeneous networks, device-to-device communications and massive multiple-input multiple-output communications have been analysed as possible technologies for improvement of wireless networks energy efficiency. Additionally, approaches related to the DC resource management, DCs power management, green DC monitoring and thermal management in DCs have been discussed as promising approaches to improvement of DC power usage efficiency. For each of analysed technologies, future research challenges and open issues have been summarised and discussed. Lastly, an overview of the accepted papers in the Special Issue dedicated to the green, energy-efficient and sustainable networks is presented.},

Over the last few years, the Internet of Things (IoT) has grown in protocols, implementations and use cases. In terms of communication protocols, the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) stands out among the rest. This is extremely lightweight and capable of running in resource constrained devices and networks. There exist many implementations of CoAP, each of these with its own particular features and requirements. Therefore, it is important to choose the CoAP implementation that suits better to the specific requirements of each application. This paper presents a feature and empirical comparison of several open source CoAP implementations. First of all, it surveys current CoAP implementations, and compares them in terms of built-in core, extensions, target platform, programming language and interoperability. Then, it analyzes their performance in terms of latency, memory and CPU consumption in a real testbed deployed in an industrial scenario."

ABSTRACT = {Often the Internet of Things (IoT) is considered as a single problem domain, with proposed solutions intended to be applied across a wide range of applications. However, the privacy and security needs of critical engineering infrastructure or sensitive commercial operations are very different to the needs of a domestic Smart Home environment. Additionally, the financial and human resources available to implement security and privacy vary greatly between application domains. In domestic environments, human issues may be as important as technical issues. After surveying existing solutions for enhancing IoT security, the paper identifies key future requirements for trusted Smart Home systems. A gateway architecture is selected as the most appropriate for resource-constrained devices, and for high system availability. Two key technologies to assist system auto-management are identified. Firstly, support for system auto-configuration will enhance system security. Secondly, the automatic update of system software and firmware is needed to maintain ongoing secure system operation.},

ABSTRACT = {With the emergence of the smart grid, both consumers and electricity providing companies can benefit from real-time interaction and pricing methods. In this work, a smart power system is considered, where consumers share a common energy source. Each consumer is equipped with a home energy management controller (HEMC) as scheduler and a smart meter. The HEMC keeps updating the utility with the load profile of the home. The smart meter is connected to a power grid having an advanced metering infrastructure which is responsible for two-way communication. Genetic teaching-learning based optimization, flower pollination teaching learning based optimization, flower pollination BAT and flower pollination genetic algorithm based energy consumption scheduling algorithms are proposed. These algorithms schedule the loads in order to shave the peak formation without compromising user comfort. The proposed algorithms achieve optimal energy consumption profile for the home appliances equipped with sensors to maximize the consumer benefits in a fair and efficient manner by exchanging control messages. Control messages contain energy consumption of consumer and real-time pricing information. Simulation results show that proposed algorithms reduce the peak-to-average ratio by 34.56% and help the users to reduce their energy expenses by 42.41% without compromising the comfort. The daily discomfort is reduced by 28.18%.},

ABSTRACT = {In recent years, the improvement of wireless protocols, the development of cloud services and the lower cost of hardware have started a new era for smart homes. One such enabling technologies is fog computing, which extends cloud computing to the edge of a network allowing for developing novel Internet of Things (IoT) applications and services. Under the IoT fog computing paradigm, IoT gateways are usually utilized to exchange messages with IoT nodes and a cloud. WiFi and ZigBee stand out as preferred communication technologies for smart homes. WiFi has become very popular, but it has a limited application due to its high energy consumption and the lack of standard mesh networking capabilities for low-power devices. For such reasons, ZigBee was selected by many manufacturers for developing wireless home automation devices. As a consequence, these technologies may coexist in the 2.4 GHz band, which leads to collisions, lower speed rates and increased communications latencies. This article presents ZiWi, a distributed fog computing Home Automation System (HAS) that allows for carrying out seamless communications among ZigBee and WiFi devices. This approach diverges from traditional home automation systems, which often rely on expensive central controllers. In addition, to ease the platform&rsquo;s building process, whenever possible, the system makes use of open-source software (all the code of the nodes is available on GitHub) and Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) hardware. The initial results, which were obtained in a number of representative home scenarios, show that the developed fog services respond several times faster than the evaluated cloud services, and that cross-interference has to be taken seriously to prevent collisions. In addition, the current consumption of ZiWi&rsquo;s nodes was measured, showing the impact of encryption mechanisms.},

ABSTRACT = {Development of the Internet of Things (IoT) opens many new challenges. As IoT devices are getting smaller and smaller, the problems of so-called &ldquo;constrained devices&rdquo; arise. The traditional Internet protocols are not very well suited for constrained devices comprising localized network nodes with tens of devices primarily communicating with each other (e.g., various sensors in Body Area Network communicating with each other). These devices have very limited memory, processing, and power resources, so traditional security protocols and architectures also do not fit well. To address these challenges the Fog computing paradigm is used in which all constrained devices, or Edge nodes, primarily communicate only with less-constrained Fog node device, which collects all data, processes it and communicates with the outside world. We present a new lightweight secure self-authenticable transfer protocol (SSATP) for communications between Edge nodes and Fog nodes. The primary target of the proposed protocol is to use it as a secure transport for CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol) in place of UDP (User Datagram Protocol) and DTLS (Datagram Transport Layer Security), which are traditional choices in this scenario. SSATP uses modified header fields of standard UDP packets to transfer additional protocol handling and data flow management information as well as user data authentication information. The optional redundant data may be used to provide increased resistance to data losses when protocol is used in unreliable networks. The results of experiments presented in this paper show that SSATP is a better choice than UDP with DTLS in the cases, where the CoAP block transfer mode is used and/or in lossy networks.},

ABSTRACT = {The Internet of things has profoundly changed the way we imagine information science and architecture, and smart homes are an important part of this domain. Created a decade ago, the few existing prototypes use technologies of the day, forcing designers to create centralized and costly architectures that raise some issues concerning reliability, scalability, and ease of access which cannot be tolerated in the context of assistance. In this paper, we briefly introduce a new kind of architecture where the focus is placed on distribution. More specifically, we respond to the first issue we encountered by proposing a lightweight and portable messaging protocol. After running several tests, we observed a maximized bandwidth, whereby no packets were lost and good encryption was obtained. These results tend to prove that our innovation may be employed in a real context of distribution with small entities.},

ABSTRACT = {The IoT protocols used for data transfer in the application layer, namely the Constraint Application Protocol (CoAP) and Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT) have dependencies to the transport layer. The choice of transport, Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) or the User Datagram Protocol (UDP), on the other hand, has an impact on the Internet of Things (IoT) application level performance, especially over a wireless medium. Furthermore, we touch upon the impact of different security solutions. The motivation of this work is to look at the impact of the protocol stack on performance over a narrowband IoT (NB-IoT) link. The use case studied is infrequent small reports sent from the sensor device to a central cloud storage over a last mile radio access link. We find that while CoAP/UDP based transport performs consistently better both in terms of latency, coverage, and system capacity, MQTT/TCP also works when the system is less loaded.},

ABSTRACT = {As the adoption of distributed generation and energy storage grows and the attention to energy efficiency rises, Energy Management is assuming a growing importance in smart homes. Energy Management Systems (EMSs) should be easily deployable on smart homes and seamlessly integrate with the Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem, including generators and storage devices. This paper redesigns a previously presented EMS to reduce its computational complexity, implement it on a Raspberry Pi, and make it compatible with the IoT paradigm. The EMS manages the power flows between smart home loads, renewable generators, electrical storage, and power grid. It communicates with a network of wireless sensors for electrical appliances and with a cloud-based utility data aggregator. The EMS uses Artificial Intelligence and a Dynamic Programming algorithm to fulfill two objectives at the same time: lowering the end user&rsquo;s electricity bill and reducing the uncertainty on the power exchanged between the end user and the grid manager. The latter goal is obtained by an effective compensation of forecasting errors. A test bench emulating four smart homes was used to measure the effectiveness of the EMS and the efficiency of the proposed implementation. The results show an uncertainty of the aggregated exchanged power of only 2.88% and a reduction of the electrical bill for end-users of up to 3.23%. Furthermore, the EMS can complete its most onerous task in less than 9 min. The good performance of the proposed EMS makes it a candidate for fast adoption by the market.},

ABSTRACT = {The Internet of Things (IoT) and Demand Response (DR) combined have transformed the way Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) contribute to saving energy and reducing costs, while also giving consumers more control over their energy footprint. Unlike current price and incentive based DR strategies, we propose a DR model that promotes consumers reaching coordinated behaviour towards more sustainable (and green) communities. A cooperative DR system is designed not only to bolster energy efficiency management at both home and district levels, but also to integrate the renewable energy resource information into the community&rsquo;s energy management. Initially conceived in a centralised way, a data collector called the &ldquo;aggregator&rdquo; will handle the operation scheduling requirements given the consumers&rsquo; time preferences and the available electricity supply from renewables. Evaluation on the algorithm implementation shows feasible computational cost (CC) in different scenarios of households, communities and consumer behaviour. Number of appliances and timeframe flexibility have the greatest impact on the reallocation cost. A discussion on the communication, security and hardware platforms is included prior to future pilot deployment.},

This paper presents a comprehensive review of piezoelectric energy-harvesting techniques developed in the last decade. The piezoelectric effect has been widely adopted to convert mechanical energy to electricity, due to its high energy conversion efficiency, ease of implementation, and miniaturization. From the viewpoint of applications, we are most concerned about whether an energy harvester can generate sufficient power under a variable excitation. Therefore, here we concentrate on methodologies leading to high power output and broad operational bandwidth. Different designs, nonlinear methods, optimization techniques, and harvesting materials are reviewed and discussed in depth. Furthermore, we identify four promising applications: shoes, pacemakers, tire pressure monitoring systems, and bridge and building monitoring. We review new high-performance energy harvesters proposed for each application."

ABSTRACT = {Acoustic energy is a type of environmental energy source that can be scavenged and converted into electrical energy for small-scale power applications. In general, incident sound power density is low and structural design for acoustic energy harvesting (AEH) is crucial. This review article summarizes the mechanisms of AEH, which include the Helmholtz resonator approach, the quarter-wavelength resonator approach, and the acoustic metamaterial approach. The details of recently proposed AEH devices and mechanisms are carefully reviewed and compared. Because acoustic metamaterials have the advantages of compactness, effectiveness, and flexibility, it is suggested that the emerging metamaterial-based AEH technique is highly suitable for further development. It is demonstrated that the AEH technique will become an essential part of the environmental energy-harvesting research field. As a multidisciplinary research topic, the major challenge is to integrate AEH devices into engineering structures and make composite structures smarter to achieve large-scale AEH.},

ABSTRACT = {Active participation of end users in energy markets is identified as one of the major challenges in the energy transition context. One option to bridge the gap between customers and the market is aggregators of smart homes or buildings. This paper presents an optimization model from the standpoint of an aggregator of residential prosumers who have PV panels, electric water heaters, and batteries installed at home level. This aggregator participates in the day-ahead energy market to minimize operation costs by controlling the settings of flexible devices. Given that energy prices, PV production, and demand have uncertain behavior, appropriate models should be used to include these effects. In the present work, Adjustable Robust Optimization (ARO) is used to include uncertainty in the optimization model, and a comparative study of modifications to this formulation is carried out to determine its potential and limitations. The comparative analysis is performed from the point of view of average cost and risk, after performing Monte Carlo simulation. Simulations show the advantages of using an ARO framework when compared to deterministic approaches and also allow us to conclude about the advantages of using the proposed alternative formulation to find more attractive solutions for an aggregator.},

ABSTRACT = {The world is progressing towards a more advanced society where end-consumers have access to local renewable-based generation and advanced forms of information and technology. Hence, it is in a current state of transition between the traditional approach to power generation and distribution, where end-consumers of electricity have typically been inactive in their involvement with energy markets and a new approach that integrates their active participation. This new approach includes the use of distributed energy resources (DER) such as renewable-based generation and demand response (DR), which are being rapidly adopted by end-consumers where incentives are strong. This paper presents the role of the DR aggregator to effectively integrate DER technology as a new source of energy capacity into electricity networks using information communication technology and industry knowledge., Based on DR aggregators, this framework will efficiently facilitate renewable energy integration and customer engagement into the electricity market. To this aim, advantages and disadvantages of DR aggregators are discussed in this paper from political, economic, social, and technological (PEST) points of view. Based on this analysis, a strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) analysis for a typical DR aggregator is presented.},

ABSTRACT = {Smart city systems embrace major challenges associated with climate change, energy efficiency, mobility and future services by embedding the virtual space into a complex cyber-physical system. Those systems are constantly evolving and scaling up, involving a wide range of integration among users, devices, utilities, public services and also policies. Modelling such complex dynamic systems’ architectures has always been essential for the development and application of techniques/tools to support design and deployment of integration of new components, as well as for the analysis, verification, simulation and testing to ensure trustworthiness. This article reports on the definition and implementation of a scalable component-based architecture that supports a cooperative energy demand response (DR) system coordinating energy usage between neighbouring households. The proposed architecture, called refinement of Cyber-Physical Component Systems (rCPCS), which extends the refinement calculus for component and object system (rCOS) modelling method, is implemented using Eclipse Extensible Coordination Tools (ECT), i.e., Reo coordination language. With rCPCS implementation in Reo, we specify the communication, synchronisation and co-operation amongst the heterogeneous components of the system assuring, by design scalability and the interoperability, correctness of component cooperation.},

ABSTRACT = {Internet-of-Things (IoT) is a technology that is extensively being used in various fields. Companies like Samsung, LG, and Apple are launching home appliances that use IoT as a part of their smart home business. Currently, Intelligent Things which combine artificial intelligence (AI) and IoT are being developed. Most of these devices are configured to collect and respond to human behavior (motion, voice, etc.) through built-in sensors. If IoT devices do not ensure high security, personal information could be leaked. This paper describes the IoT security threats that can cause information leakage from a hierarchical viewpoint of cyberspace. In addition, because these smart home-based IoT devices are closely related to human life, considering social damage is a problem. To overcome this, we propose a framework to measure the risk of IoT devices based on security scenarios that can occur in a smart home.},

Household energy efficiency performance till 2020 was evaluated based on increase of equipment energy efficiency driven by technological progress. The results of energy efficiency evaluation for particular household shows that 1219 kWh savings can be achieved due to improvements of energy performance of some mostly used appliances until 2020 (i.e., reduction in electricity consumption of 13\% if compared to present scenario).

ABSTRACT = {Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) has become an attractive research topic due to growing interest in remote monitoring of older people. Development in sensor technologies and advances in wireless communications allows to remotely offer smart assistance and monitor those people at their own home, increasing their quality of life. In this context, Wireless Acoustic Sensor Networks (WASN) provide a suitable way for implementing AAL systems which can be used to infer hazardous situations via environmental sounds identification. Nevertheless, satisfying sensor solutions have not been found with the considerations of both low cost and high performance. In this paper, we report the design and implementation of a wireless acoustic sensor to be located at the edge of a WASN for recording and processing environmental sounds which can be applied to AAL systems for personal healthcare because it has the following significant advantages: low cost, small size, audio sampling and computation capabilities for audio processing. The proposed wireless acoustic sensor is able to record audio samples at least to 10 kHz sampling frequency and 12-bit resolution. Also, it is capable of doing audio signal processing without compromising the sample rate and the energy consumption by using a new microcontroller released at the last quarter of 2016. The proposed low cost wireless acoustic sensor has been verified using four randomness tests for doing statistical analysis and a classification system of the recorded sounds based on audio fingerprints.},

ABSTRACT = {The research and the implementation of home automation are getting more popular because the Internet of Things holds promise for making homes smarter through wireless technologies. The installation of systems based on wireless networks can play a key role also in the extension of the smart grid towards smart homes, that can be deemed as one of the most important components of smart grids. This paper proposes a fuzzy-based solution for smart energy management in a home automation wireless network. The approach, by using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), introduces a Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC) in order to improve a Home Energy Management (HEM) scheme, addressing the power load of standby appliances and their loads in different hours of the day. Since the consumer is involved in the choice of switching on/off of home appliances, the approach introduced in this work proposes a fuzzy-based solution in order to manage the consumer feedbacks. Simulation results show that the proposed solution is efficient in terms of reducing peak load demand, electricity consumption charges with an increase comfort level of consumers. The performance of the proposed BLE-based wireless network scenario are validated in terms of packet delivery ratio, delay, and jitter and are compared to IEEE 802.15.4 technology.},

ABSTRACT = {The Smart Meter (SM) is an essential tool for successful balancing the demand-offer energy curve. It allows the linking of the consumption and production measurements with the time information and the customer’s identity, enabling the substitution of flat-price billing with smarter solutions, such as Time-of-Use or Real-Time Pricing. In addition to sending data to the energy operators for billing and monitoring purposes, Smart Meters must be able to send the same data to customer devices in near-real-time conditions, enabling new services such as instant energy awareness and home automation. In this article, we review the ongoing situation in Europe regarding real-time services for the final customers. Then, we review the architectural and technological options that have been considered for the roll-out phase of the Italian second generation of Smart Meters. Finally, we identify a collection of use cases, along with their functional and performance requirements, and discuss what architectures and communications technologies can meet these requirements.},

ABSTRACT = {Demand response technology is a key technology for distributing electricity tasks in response to electricity prices in a smart grid system. In the current demand response research, there has been much demand for an automated energy scheduling scheme that uses smart devices for residential customers in the smart grid. In this paper, two automated energy scheduling schemes are proposed for residential smart grid demand response systems: semi-automated scheduling and fully-automated scheduling. If it is possible to set the appliance preference, semi-automated scheduling will be conducted, and if it is impossible, fully-automated scheduling will be operated. The formulated optimization problems consider the electricity bill along with the user convenience. For the fully-automated scheduling, the appliance preference can automatically be found according to appliance type from the electricity consumption statistics. A performance evaluation validates that the proposed scheme shifts operation to avoid peak load, that the electricity bill is significantly reduced, and that user convenience is satisfied.},

abstract = {With the arrival of smart grid era and the advent of advanced communication and information infrastructures, bidirectional communication, advanced metering infrastructure, energy storage systems and home area networks would revolutionize the patterns of electricity usage and energy conservation at the consumption premises. Coupled with the emergence of vehicle-to-grid technologies and massive distributed renewable energy, there is a profound transition for the energy management pattern from the conventional centralized infrastructure towards the autonomous responsive demand and cyber-physical energy systems with renewable and stored energy sources. Under the sustainable smart grid paradigm, the smart house with its home energy management system (HEMS) plays an important role to improve the efficiency, economics, reliability, and energy conservation for distribution systems. In this paper, a brief overview on the architecture and functional modules of smart HEMS is presented. Then, the advanced HEMS infrastructures and home appliances in smart houses are thoroughly analyzed and reviewed. Furthermore, the utilization of various building renewable energy resources in HEMS, including solar, wind, biomass and geothermal energies, is surveyed. Lastly, various home appliance scheduling strategies to reduce the residential electricity cost and improve the energy efficiency from power generation utilities are also investigated.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper provides a study of the smart grid projects realised in Europe and presents their technological solutions with a focus on smart metering Low Voltage (LV) applications. Special attention is given to the telecommunications technologies used. For this purpose, we present the telecommunication technologies chosen by several European utilities for the accomplishment of their smart meter national roll-outs. Further on, a study is performed based on the European Smart Grid Projects, highlighting their technological options. The range of the projects analysed covers the ones including smart metering implementation as well as those in which smart metering applications play a significant role in the overall project success. The survey reveals that various topics are directly or indirectly linked to smart metering applications, like smart home/building, energy management, grid monitoring and integration of Renewable Energy Sources (RES). Therefore, the technological options that lie behind such projects are pointed out. For reasons of completeness, we also present the main characteristics of the telecommunication technologies that are found to be used in practice for the LV grid.},

ABSTRACT = {We present an Arduino-based automation system to control the streetlights based on solar rays and object&rsquo;s detection. We aim to design various systems to achieve the desired operations, which no longer require time-consuming manual switching of the streetlights. The proposed work is accomplished by using an Arduino microcontroller, a light dependent resistor (LDR) and infrared-sensors while, two main contributions are presented in this work. Firstly, we show that the streetlights can be controlled based on the night and object&rsquo;s detection. In which the streetlights automatically turn to DIM state at night-time and turn to HIGH state on object&rsquo;s detection, while during day-time the streetlights will remain OFF. Secondly, the proposed automated system is further extended to skip the DIM condition at night time, and streetlights turn ON based on the objects&rsquo; detection only. In addition, an automatic door system is introduced to improve the safety measurements, and most importantly, a counter is set that will count the number of objects passed through the road. The proposed systems are designed at lab-scale prototype to experimentally validate the efficiency, reliability, and low-cost of the systems. We remark that the proposed systems can be easily tested and implemented under real conditions at large-scale in the near future, that will be useful in the future applications for automation systems and smart homes.},

Each power outlet of the system embeds a microcontroller, a 2.4 GHz ZigBee interface, RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) reader, a relay, and a current sensor. The main features of the system include the remote control of the power outlet, real-time monitoring of the current consumption, the customization and programming of the power supply time schedule, the automatic interruption of vampire currents, and the prevention of certain types of electrical fires and electrocutions. A prototype with such features has been implemented and tested in a simple home automation network in order to validate its functionalities. The results show that the system reacts fast and avoids overconsumptions and electrocutions, being able to make the next generation of homes safer and smarter. }

abstract = "The increasing demand for electricity and the emergence of smart grids have presented new opportunities for a home energy management system (HEMS) that can reduce energy usage. The HEMS incorporates a demand response (DR) tool that shifts and curtails demand to improve home energy consumption. This system commonly creates optimal consumption schedules by considering several factors, such as energy costs, environmental concerns, load profiles, and consumer comfort. With the deployment of smart meters, performing load control using the HEMS with DR-enabled appliances has become possible. This paper provides a comprehensive review on previous and current research related to the HEMS by considering various DR programs, smart technologies, and load scheduling controllers. The application of artificial intelligence for load scheduling controllers, such as artificial neural network, fuzzy logic, and adaptive neural fuzzy inference system, is also reviewed. Heuristic optimization techniques, which are widely used for optimal scheduling of various electrical devices in a smart home, are also discussed.",

ABSTRACT = {In recent years, the increment of distributed electricity generation based on renewable energy sources and improvement of communication technologies have caused the development of next-generation power grids known as smart grids. The structures of smart grids have bidirectional communication capability and enable the connection of energy generated from distributed sources to any point on the grid. They also support consumers in energy efficiency by creating opportunities for management of power consumption. The information on power consumption and load profiles of home appliances is essential to perform load management in the dwelling accurately. In this study, the power consumption data for all the basic home appliances, utilized in a two-person family in Çankırı, Turkey, was obtained with high resolution in one-second intervals. The detailed power consumption analysis and load profile were executed for each home appliance. The obtained data is not only the average power consumption of each appliance but also characterizes different operating modes or their cycles. In addition, the impact of these devices on home energy management studies and their standby power consumptions were also discussed. The acquired data is an important source to determine the load profile of individual home appliances precisely in home energy management studies. Although the results of this study do not completely reflect the energy consumption behavior of the people who live in this region, they can reveal the trends in load demands based on a real sample and customer consumption behavior of a typical two-person family.},

abstract="We study an offline scheduling problem arising in demand response management in smart grid. Consumers send in power requests with a flexible set of timeslots during which their requests can be served. For example, a consumer may request the dishwasher to operate for one hour during the periods 8am to 11am or 2pm to 4pm. The grid controller, upon receiving power requests, schedules each request within the specified duration. The electricity cost is measured by a convex function of the load in each timeslot. The objective of the problem is to schedule all requests with the minimum total electricity cost. As a first attempt, we consider a special case in which the power requirement and the duration a request needs service are both unit-size. For this problem, we present a polynomial time offline algorithm that gives an optimal solution and show that the time complexity can be further improved if the given set of timeslots is a contiguous interval.",
